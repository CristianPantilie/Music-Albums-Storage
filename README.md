 A project I've had to do for my Procedural Programming course at University. While completely impractical, it has given me a lot of headaches and in the end taught me a lot.
 I think just about every feature of the C programming language is to be found in here.
 
 
 It is a Windows-based application that stores data about music albums. It can read both from the console and file and it can store the data statically as well as dynamically. It contains features that had me use C functions such as qsort, strtok, memmove etc.
 

For reading from file the following format has to be used:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;album,artist,apparition,grade,category,type,album(A) or single(S),duration

Mandatory comma between them

No spaces before or after the commas
